## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

### From Source

```bash
# Install from GitHub
cargo install --git https://github.com/eyalev/stop-app-with-port

# Or clone and build locally
git clone https://github.com/eyalev/stop-app-with-port
cd stop-app-with-port
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### List all processes using ports
```bash
stop-app-with-port
# or
stop-app-with-port --list
```

Example output:
```
+------+-------+--------------+----------------+
| port | pid   | process_name | command        |
+------+-------+--------------+----------------+
| 3000 | 12264 | node         | node server.js |
| 8080 | 15432 | java         | java -jar app.jar |
+------+-------+--------------+----------------+
```

### Check which process is using a specific port
```bash
stop-app-with-port --port 3000
# or
stop-app-with-port -p 3000
```

### Kill process using a specific port
```bash
stop-app-with-port --kill 3000
# or
stop-app-with-port -k 3000
```

The tool will:
1. Show you which process is using the port
2. Ask for confirmation before killing
3. Try with regular permissions first
4. Offer sudo fallback if needed

### Help
```bash
stop-app-with-port --help
```

## How it works

The tool uses both `netstat` and `lsof` commands to comprehensively find processes using network ports. It provides detailed information including:

- Port number
- Process ID (PID)
- Process name
- Full command line

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS (Windows support coming soon)
- `netstat` command (usually pre-installed)
- `lsof` command (usually pre-installed)
